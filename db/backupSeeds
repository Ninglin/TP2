	%{<p>Crossing over into general-interest non-fiction from his popular programming
      manuals, Charles Petzold has written Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and
      Software. It's a carefully written, carefully researched gem that will appeal to anyone who
      wants to understand computer technology at its most essential levels. Readers learn about
      number systems(decimal, octal, binary and all that) through Petzold's patient (and frequently
      entertaining) prose, then discover the logical systems that are used to process them. There's
      loads of historical information, too. From Louis Braille's development of his eponymous
      raised-dot code to Intel Corporation's release of its early microprocessors, Petzold presents
      the stories of people trying to find ways to communicate with (and by means of) mechanical and
      electrical devices. It's a fascinating progression of technologies and the author presents a
      clear statement of how they fit together. The real value of Code is in its explanations of
      technologies that have been obscured for years behind fancy user interfaces and programming
      environments that, in the name of rapid application development, insulate the programmer from
      the machine. In a section on machine language, Petzold dissects the instruction sets of the
      genre-defining Intel 8080 and Motorola6800 processors. He walks the reader through the process
      of performing various operations with each chip, explaining which op codes poke which values
      into which registers along the way. Petzold knows that the hidden language of computers
      exhibits real beauty. In Code, he helps his readers appreciate it. --David Wall Topics
      covered: Mechanical and electrical representations of words and numbers, number systems, logic
      gates, performing mathematical operations with logic gates, microprocessors, machine code,
      memory and programming languages. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition

Product.create(:title => 'The Mythical Man Month and Other Essays on Software Engineering', 
	:description => 
	%{<p>Few books on software project management have been as influential and timeless as
      The Mythical Man-Month . With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking
      opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw
      from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for
      OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 20 years after the initial publication of his book,
      Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers
      already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time. The added
      chapters contain (1) a crisp condensation of all the propositions asserted in the original
      book, including Brooks' central argument in The Mythical Man-Month: that large programming
      projects suffer management problems different from small ones due to the division of labor;
      that the conceptual integrity of the product is therefore critical; and that it is difficult
      but possible to achieve this unity; (2) Brooks' view of these propositions a generation later;
      (3) a reprint of his classic 1986 paper "No Silver Bullet"; and (4) today's thoughts on the
      1986 assertion, "There will be no silver bullet within ten years.</p>},

	%{<p>The best introduction to Haskell available. There are many paths towards becoming
      comfortable and competent with the language but I think studying this book is the quickest
      path. I urge readers of this magazine to recommend Programming in Haskell to anyone who has
      been thinking about learning the language.' Duncan Coutts, Monad Reader 'Two groups of people
      must consider this book. The first is professors interested in rapidly introducing students to
      fundamental concepts in functional programming. This book, supplemented with online resources
      and professorial guidance could easily serve as the textbook for a semester-long course on
      functional programming. The second group is programmers interested in surveying the functional
      paradigm as quickly as possible.' Journal of Functional Programming</p>},
